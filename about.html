                    <h1>A little bit about me:<div class="about-image" style="background-image:url(images/picture2.jpg)"></div></h1>
                    <p>I made the career transition to software engineering from my time as a building inspector and building plans examiner. During my previous career, I found that I love tackling complex projects and breaking them down into bite-sized pieces, allowing me to understand the big picture. This passion led me to software engineering, as this is a fundamental aspect of the profession. In order to build a strong technical background and successfully apply my problem solving skills, I have done extensive self-directed studying and enrolled into Rithm School to ensure my development follows the correct path.</p>
                    <p>My previous career in the building industry was rewarding and cultivated skills that are applicable to any industry. I have worked both as a consultant and for local jurisdictions as a plans examiner for three years and as a building inspector for about six months. This provided me with a diverse working environment where I had to adjust to differing stakeholders, company priorities, and working styles. Through working in diverse environments, I found that I enjoyed evaluating my situation and adjusting my approach to effectively find a solution that meets the needs of the stakeholder, such as a local jurisdiction or a homeowner. </p>
